    "*Solved By 6,245*\n",
    "<p>Lucas Zhang</p>\n",
    "<p><dfn>Nim</dfn> is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.</li>\n",
    "<li>On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.</li>\n",
    "<li>The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ that returns:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or</li>\n",
    "<li>non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>current player moves to $(1,2,1)$</li>\n",
    "<li>opponent moves to $(1,0,1)$</li>\n",
    "<li>current player moves to $(0,0,1)$</li>\n",
    "<li>opponent moves to $(0,0,0)$, and so wins.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For how many positive integers $n \\le 2^{30}$ does $X(n,2n,3n) = 0$ ?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Solution</b>: To solve the problem, we first need to define state <b><i>S</i></b>: Write the number of stones in each heap in binary. If the number of each digits add up to 0 or 2, we called this is state <b><i>S</i></b>. For example, $(1,2,3)$ is in <b><i>S</i></b> because their binary forms are </p>\n",
    "<p>$1 = 0 1$ </p>\n",
    "<p>$2 = 1 0$ </p>\n",
    "<p>$3 = 1 1$ </p>\n",
    "<p>and they sum up to $2 2$. Moreover, $(0,0,0)$ is also in <b><i>S</i></b>. For another example, $(3,6,9)$ is not in state <b><i>S</i></b>, because </p>\n",
    "<p>$3 = 0 0 1 1$ </p>\n",
    "<p>$6 = 0 1 1 0$ </p>\n",
    "<p>$9 = 1 0 0 1$ </p>\n",
    "<p>and they sum up to $1 1 2 2$. </p>\n",
    "<p>According to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/1967631\">Bouton</a> (1901-1902), <b>(i)</b> All states <b><i>S</i></b> will be diminished if we move any rocks from one heap. This is because given the number of rocks in the other two heaps, the number that establishes <b><i>S</i></b> is unique. <b>(ii)</b> If <b><i>S</i></b> is diminished in the first step, it can always be re-established in the next step. </p>\n",
    "<p>Following these two theorems, we can show that if one player starts with <b><i>S</i></b>, he or she have to diminish it in the move and his or her opponent should always re-established <b><i>S</i></b> in the next step by \"perfect strategy\". Therefore, the player will always start his or her move with <b><i>S</i></b>, and the number of rocks in heaps will eventually go to $(0,0,0)$. Namely, the player starts with $(0,0,0)$ and loses. Otherwise, if one player start with a non-<b><i>S</i></b> state, he or she should establish <b><i>S</i></b> in his or her movement, and his or her opponent will always start the game with <b><i>S</i></b> and enventually lose. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We may check how many positive integers $n \\le 2^{30}$ would initially establish <b><i>S</i></b>. However, it can be computationally hard. By observation of the number combination of $(n,2n,3n)$, we can identify that if we have in its binary form $2n$ equals to adding one 0 at the of $n$. For example, $3 = 0 0 1 1$ and $6 = 0 1 1 0$. Note that if we add a 0 at the end of 3, it becomes 6. Therefore, if we want the same digits in the three numbers add up to 0 or 2, the digits in $n$ have to be $\\cdots 0 \\cdots$ or $\\cdots 01 \\cdots$. The corresponding digits in $2n$ are $\\cdots 0 \\cdots$ or $\\cdots 10 \\cdots$, and the corresponding digits in $3n$ are $\\cdots 0 \\cdots$ or $\\cdots 11 \\cdots$.<p/>\n",
    "<p>Therefore, we can use either $\\cdots 0 \\cdots$ or $\\cdots 10 \\cdots$ to fill the 31 digits of the $2^{30}$. As the three piles of rock contain n, 2n, 3n rock, we must obeserve 11 10 01 sequence or sequesetive 0s. Supposing we have $f(a)$ methods to fill for $a$ digits, we have $f(a) = f(a-1) + f(a-2)$. Thus, this problem becomes to solve $f(31)$, excluding $n = 0$ but including $n = 2^{30}$.<\\p>\n",
